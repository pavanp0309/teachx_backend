Secure RBAC System â€“ Implementation Guide & Documentation
ðŸ“Œ Key Security Rules & Edge Cases
Your RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system must follow enterprise-level security to prevent privilege escalation, insider threats, and unauthorized actions. Below are the key security principles:

ðŸ›¡ 1. Role Hierarchy & Promotion Rules
Role	Permissions	Promotion Allowed By
Student	Limited access, enroll in courses, take tests	Trainer, Admin, Super Admin
Trainer	Conduct classes, upload materials, manage students	Admin, Super Admin
Admin	Manage users, courses, batches, and trainers	Super Admin Only
Super Admin	Full control, can promote/demote Admins	Only one per organization


ðŸš¨ Edge Cases Prevented:
âœ” Students cannot be directly promoted to Admin/Super Admin
âœ” Super Admin cannot be deleted unless another Super Admin exists
âœ” Admins cannot promote themselves or others to Super Admin
âœ” Super Admin promotion requires multi-factor authentication (OTP/email verification)
âœ” Only existing Admins can be promoted to Super Admin

ðŸ›¡ 2. Security Measures to Prevent Attacks
Attack Type	Mitigation Strategy
Privilege Escalation	Multi-step role verification, Super Admin approval
JWT Token Theft	Session tracking, Token expiration & Revocation
Brute Force Attacks	Rate-limiting, Captcha verification
Role Tampering via API Calls	Fine-grained access control, ACL on APIs
Malicious Admins Creating Fake Accounts	Domain-based Admin verification
Super Admin Deletion Accidentally	At least one Super Admin is always required
